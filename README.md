# React-Api


Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

This interface has the following features

   - Text entries to filter data
   - Sort data or buttons.
(When you click on the columns, you can sort them as ASC or Desc.)
   - A table to display data.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

With useState and useEffect, the state of the component is tracked and the component is created and updated.

Using the axios library, data is retrieved from the API (`your api`) or another API. If an error occurs while receiving data, the error condition is determined by setError.

## Operation

Users can be able to filter and sort data using the API

Users can adjust the page size (how many results are displayed)

Error handling: Users are notified when they submit an incorrect API request or an error occurs
